# to-do-list
This is a to-do-list. Had fun doing it even though it was pretty challenging. 
It has light/dark theme, responsive on all devices, and so on.

That aside it does have some functionality issues.. 

1. Although it does persist the theme itself, it does not persist the created elements
2. Items left & Clear completed work, but the other 3 (All, Active, Completed) don't.
4. Dragging elements is not implemented.
