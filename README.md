# to-do-list
This is a to-do-list. Had fun doing it even though it was pretty challenging. 
It has light/dark theme, responsive on all devices, and so on.

That aside it does have some functionality issues.. 

1. Although it does persist the theme itself, it does not persist the created elements
2. Items left & Clear completed work, but the other 3 "buttons" (All, Active, Completed) don't work. 
2.1 I created some solution for the buttons but because it was throwing erros when I was messing with it, I decided to just leave it as is, until I can come up with a better solution. 
3. Dragging elements is not implemented.
