# to-do-list
Had a blast doing this To-do-list and learned a lot of things.
Initially I started this project in order to just learn how to toggle light & dark theme but ended up learning a lot more.
1. Light & Dark theme.
2. Drag and drop
3. Persisting data with local storage
4. forEach type of loops and so on.

Check it out, let me know if there are things I could improve, would love some feedback.
